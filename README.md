# CSE-335-project-1
In CSE 335 Project 1, we are meeting twice a week and once with our TA; we could not do it in time, but it was worth having. By working on this project, practically I was being trained to execute teamwork, coding, and problem-solving skills. Collaboration, time management, and iterative development in this process are of great essence.
